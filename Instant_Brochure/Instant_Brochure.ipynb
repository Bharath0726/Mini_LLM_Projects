      "What is health insurance?\n",
      "Health insurance is a plan, or policy, that covers a percentage of doctors’ visits and hospital bills. It helps offset the costs of both planned and unplanned medical needs. Medical care can be expensive, but health insurance may help lessen the financial burden.\n",
      "And health insurance isn’t just for when you’re sick or injured. It can also help you stay healthy through preventive care and wellness programs. This may help you save money, too, by catching potential health concerns before they become larger issues.\n",
      "How does health insurance work?\n",
      "Health insurance is a contract between you and an insurance company (the insurer). When you purchase a plan, you become a member of that plan. Each month, you’ll likely pay a fee, called a premium, to use the plan.\n",
      "There are many different types of health plans, but they generally work the same way. You pay for some medical costs and your insurer pays for some costs. How those costs break out depend on your specific plan benefits and coverage.\n",
      "Learn more about how health insurance works\n",
      "How do I get health insurance?\n",
      "Finding the right health insurance plan depends on a variety of factors. These include things like your age, health and financial situation. For example, if you’re over 65 or have a qualifying disability or special situation, you may be eligible for\n",

      "You may also see terms like HMO, PPO, EPO and POS ­— these refer to the four basic kinds of provider networks that certain health plans may offer.

      "How much does health insurance cost?\n",
      "It depends. A variety of factors impact how much you pay. These can include your age, your location and lifestyle habits. It also depends on the type of plan you choose. With some plans, you may pay less up front, but more when you receive care. For other plans, the opposite can be true.\n",

      "What does health insurance cover?\n",
      "Coverage is unique to each health plan. Many plans may cover things like preventive care, prescription drugs, hospital stays, mental health services and more. A plan may cover the full cost of certain services, or you may have to share costs (by paying a copay or coinsurance, for example) until you meet a deductible or out-of-pocket limit.\n",
      "Make sure to review benefits and coverage before choosing a plan. You can find this information in the plan’s Summary of Benefits and Coverage.

      "What is supplemental insurance?\n",
      "Supplemental health insurance typically covers services that your other health plan does not — such as dental or vision costs. Because chances are, your medical insurance plan isn’t going to cover everything. Completing your coverage with supplemental plans can save you money and help protect against unexpected costs.\n",
      "Why choose supplemental insurance?\n",
      "No one expects something major to happen to their health, but when it does, supplemental plans can help protect you and your family. Here are a few reasons why these plans may be a smart decision.\n",
      "Get complete coverage\n",
      "Filling in your coverage with supplemental plans means you’ll have help to pay for out-of-pocket costs not covered by your regular medical plan.\n",
      "Protect your finances\n",
      "Choosing cash benefit plans that pay a lump sum can give you peace of mind that you’re protected if an unexpected medical event happens — like a critical illness or accident.\n",
      "Customize for your needs\n",
      "With a variety of supplemental plans available, you can choose coverage that matches your age, family and situation so you have coverage that’s right for your life.\n",

      "Is it worth it to buy supplemental insurance?\n",
      "The answer to that depends on your needs. For certain people and situations, supplemental insurance is very much \"worth\" getting.\n",
      "Are you an active family, always on the go? Then an\n",
      "accident insurance plan\n",
      "could be a good addition to your coverage.\n",
      "Does a critical illness run in your family? Then\n",
      "critical illness insurance\n",
      "may be an important purchase for you.\n",
      "Do you go to the dentist regularly? Then a\n",
      "dental insurance plan\n",
      "might make sense.\n",
      "Concerned about the costs of an unexpected hospitalization? Then a\n",
      "hospital insurance plan\n",
      "might be a sensible precaution.\n",
      "With supplemental plans covering many different needs, you may decide one or more is definitely worth the price for you and your family.\n",
      "When can I buy supplemental Insurance?\n",
      "You can enroll in a supplemental insurance plan at any time. There may be a waiting period for your coverage to begin or before some benefits can be accessed, so be sure to check the benefit details when you choose your plan.\n",
      "You may think about choosing supplemental coverage when:\n",
      "Your coverage through your employer doesn’t include coverage for dental or vision\n",
      "You’re buying your own medical plan and want to fill in your coverage, like dental or vision\n",
      "You want cash-benefit coverage to protect yourself in case of unexpected medical bills\n",
      "You have a Medicare plan and want to add supplemental plans to complete your coverage\n",
      "Can I buy supplemental insurance without having health insurance?\n",
      "A supplemental plan is not a replacement for a medical health insurance plan. It’s coverage that’s meant to be added to a health insurance plan.\n",
      "A medical health insurance plan is important to cover most of your health needs, like yearly checkups with your primary doctor or routine medical care. A supplemental plan is coverage you can add to help protect you from paying costs your medical plan won’t cover.\n",
      "What is typically covered by supplemental insurance?\n",
      "Supplemental insurance is a broad category of insurance products that typically pair with or \"supplement,\" your main health coverage. You can pick and choose the areasw that fit your particular needs. Common types of coverage include:\n",
      "Dental insurance\n",
      "– covers exams, cleanings and often more\n",
      "Vision insurance\n",
      "– covers exams and often helps pay for glasses and/or contacts\n",
      "Accident insurance\n",
      "– helps cover expenses relating to accidental injury\n",
      "Critical illness insurance\n",
      "– pays cash benefits for qualifying serious illnesses or medical conditions, like cancer or a stroke\n",
      "Hospital insurance\n",
      "– helps with the costs of a stay in a hospital\n",
      "Fixed indemnity insurance\n",
      "– (also called hospital and doctor fixed benefit health insurance) pays fixed benefits for covered medical services, often used to help pay for common medical care like doctor office visits, prescriptions and hospital stays before you've met your main health insurance deductible\n",
      "Why buy insurance bundles?\n",
      "Insurance bundles are a way to combine your coverage, so you can choose the right mix of plans to meet your unique needs. Everyone’s lifestyle and coverage needs are different, so bundling the plans you need can help ensure you’re choosing the right level of coverage for you. Depending on how plans are bundled, you could save money compared to buying these plans separately.\n",
      "For example, if you have a health plan that doesn’t include dental or vision coverage, you could choose to bundle a dental plan with a vision plan. Together, a dental and vision plan would likely include coverage for your routine dental and eye exams, helping you save money. And in some cases, there’s no waiting period for coverage to start.\n",
      "Is there a waiting period for services once I’m covered?\n",
      "Some plans may have what’s called a “waiting period” before some benefits become available.\n",
      "Certain plans, like dental or vision plans, may have no waiting period for some care. For example, sometimes routine dental visits or vision exams will be covered right away. But within those same plans, there could be waiting periods for major procedures related to your dental or vision care.\n",
      "It’s a good idea to check the coverage details before you enroll in a plan to understand what the waiting period may be.\n",
      "What if I need to drop my coverage?\n",
      "If you have a change in your situation, such as finding a new job that offers insurance or if your life circumstances change, you may decide you need to drop or cancel your supplemental coverage.\n",
      "When you choose UnitedHealthcare supplemental plans, underwritten by Golden Rule insurance company, you will not have a penalty for cancelling your coverage.\n",
      "As you shop around, be sure to check on this detail to be sure you understand how the plan benefits work.\n",

      "What is health insurance?\n",
      "What is health insurance exactly? It’s talked about a lot — but how does it really work and why do we need it? Here’s a simple way to look at it: Health insurance is a plan, or policy, that covers a percentage of doctors’ visits and hospital bills. It exists to help offset the costs of medical events, whether they’re planned or happen unexpectedly. Health insurance may also protect us when we’re feeling good — and may help keep us feeling that way — through wellness programs and preventive care.\n",
      "Even if you’re the picture of good health right now, you never know when you’re going to need health insurance. A car accident, an injury, a cancer diagnosis — those don’t come with warnings. Not having health insurance is a risk, not only for the preservation of your health, but also your financial security.\n",

      "LUIS VOICEOVER: My name is Luis. I've been with UnitedHealthcare for two years now. I've been playing tennis since I was 17, and would you believe, that around my 40s or 50s, a nurse actually told me that my body seems to be 20 years younger.\n",

      "I do believe in insurance because you never know what's going to happen, but all my life, I've never had to use it for a major health issue. But last year, the big health issue occurred for me. On January 2nd, this year, was the news, I have the gastric lymphoma. So I knew right away that that's serious. And that's when I started thinking also about the insurance.\n",
      "[VIDEO OF LUIS TENDING TO TENNIS COURT MAINTENANCE, PLAYING TENNIS, HANGING WITH FRIENDS]\n",
      "I had a nice, simple insurance last year. But I knew that I have to change it by January 15th  so that I could save myself financially this year. My UnitedHealthcare agent, Eric, really helped out right away. Eric knew exactly what my situation was, and I trusted him when he said, “This is what you would need”, and he gave me some numbers. It saved me time and money. It's just a phone call, and he handles things. So I didn't have to worry about that part. I focused on what needed to be done on the treatment. The insurance part was really a godsend, that it's not going to be financially trouble for me. My UnitedHealthcare agent did the extra mile to help me get through this.\n",

      "What is health insurance?\n",
      "Health insurance is a plan, or policy, that covers a percentage of doctors’ visits and hospital bills. It helps offset the costs of both planned and unplanned medical needs. Medical care can be expensive, but health insurance may help lessen the financial burden.\n",
      "And health insurance isn’t just for when you’re sick or injured. It can also help you stay healthy through preventive care and wellness programs. This may help you save money, too, by catching potential health concerns before they become larger issues.\n",
      "How does health insurance work?\n",
      "Health insurance is a contract between you and an insurance company (the insurer). When you purchase a plan, you become a member of that plan. Each month, you’ll likely pay a fee, called a premium, to use the plan.\n",
      "There are many different types of health plans, but they generally work the same way. You pay for some medical costs and your insurer pays for some costs. How those costs break out depend on your specific plan benefits and coverage.\n",
      "Learn more about how health insurance works\n",
      "How do I get health insurance?\n",
      "Finding the right health insurance plan depends on a variety of factors. These include things like your age, health and financial situation. For example, if you’re over 65 or have a qualifying disability or special situation, you may be eligible for\n",
      "Medicare\n",
      ". If you have a lower income, you may qualify for\n",
      "Medicaid\n",
      ". If you want to purchase an individual plan, an\n",
      "Affordable Care Act (ACA)\n",
      "plan could be an option. Or, you may have the option to get\n",
      "health insurance through your employer\n",
      ".\n",
      "Most health insurance plans have a special period of time, usually once a year, when you can enroll. This is called open enrollment. It’s when you can start, stop or change your health plan. Timing of open enrollment varies based on the plan.\n",
      "Learn more about open enrollment\n",
      "What are the different types of health insurance?\n",
      "There are a variety of health insurance plans that fit different needs. Some plans are offered through the government, like\n",
      "Affordable Care Act (ACA)\n",
      "plans,\n",
      "Medicare\n",
      "plans and\n",
      "Medicaid\n",
      "plans. There are also health plans you can get through your employer. Or, you can purchase a plan on your own, like\n",
      "short term health insurance\n",
      "that offers coverage for a limited amount of time. Understanding the different health insurance options can help you find the plan that may work best for you.\n",
      "You may also see terms like HMO, PPO, EPO and POS ­— these refer to the four basic kinds of provider networks that certain health plans may offer. A network may include doctors, hospitals and other providers that agree to provide services to plan members at a negotiated rate. This may help lower your out-of-pocket costs.\n",
      "Learn more about the different types of health insurance\n",
      "How much does health insurance cost?\n",
      "It depends. A variety of factors impact how much you pay. These can include your age, your location and lifestyle habits. It also depends on the type of plan you choose. With some plans, you may pay less up front, but more when you receive care. For other plans, the opposite can be true.\n",
